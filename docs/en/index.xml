Design Framework A contract is an agreement governing outcomes for actions, given a set of inputs. A contract can range from formal legal contracts (e.g., a financial transaction) to something as simple as the &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo; of a game. Typical actions can be things such as fund transfers (in the case of a financial contract) or game moves (in the case of a game contract).</description>

      <description>EOSIO is a free, open-source blockchain software protocol that provides developers and entrepreneurs with a platform on which to build, deploy and run high-performing decentralized applications.
The EOSIO software introduces a new blockchain architecture designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications. This is achieved by creating an operating system-like construct upon which applications can be built. The software provides accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication and the scheduling of applications across many CPU cores or clusters.</description>

      <description>What is a Block Producer? Block producers provide the infrastructure required to run the underlying network layer to process all transactions. Some block producers run their own &amp;ldquo;Bare Metal Servers&amp;rdquo; meaning they own and operate their physical equipment. Other Block producers provide the service by using third party cloud services.

      <description>At EOS Costa Rica we follow the DevOps principles to build and deploy software.
Automation is at the top of our priorities, everything from scaffolding to code optimization, testing, deploy and delivery.
Continuous integration allows us to detect problems early reducing costs and help us deliver robust software more rapidly.
Continuous communication and frequent one-on-one calls, as well as pair programming, are an essential part of our day to day work.</description>

      <description>A contract is an agreement governing outcomes for actions, given a set of inputs. A contract can range from formal legal contracts (e.g., a financial transaction) to something as simple as the &amp;ldquo;rules&amp;rdquo; of a game. Typical actions can be things such as fund transfers (in the case of a financial contract) or game moves (in the case of a game contract).
An EOSIO Smart Contract is software registered on the blockchain and executed on EOSIO nodes, that implements the semantics of a &amp;ldquo;contract&amp;rdquo; whose ledger of action requests are being stored on the blockchain.</description>
