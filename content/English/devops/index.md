At EOS Costa Rica we follow the DevOps principles to build and deploy software. 

Automation is at the top of our priorities, everything from scaffolding to code optimization, testing, deploy and delivery.

Continuous integration allows us to detect problems early reducing costs and help us deliver robust software more rapidly.

Continuous communication and frequent one-on-one calls as well as pair programming are essential part of our day to day work.
